# PANIC THEME

Do you wanna have the coolest theme of all time?

Panic Palette Dark uses the proper colors to create a theme you can not do without.

With a general dark based theme, and bright colored variables and elements, this theme  
is ideal for those who spent many hours in front of their monitors because it is both  
relaxing and distinct at the same time
